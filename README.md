# VLCTechFest2026

Website for the VLCTechFest2026 event.
Created with ❤ by volunteers.

## How to use

Ruby 2.7.3 required. You must use the Github Pages Gem bundled Jekyll in order to make it work properly.

To build the site and serve it through the default 4000 port:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

If you rather use Docker, you can start a functional working environment by issuing:

```
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/srv -p 4000:4000 -w /srv ruby:2.7.3 bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --watch
```
